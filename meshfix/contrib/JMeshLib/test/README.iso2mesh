=   JMeshLib mesh cleaning utility modified for iso2mesh toolbox   =
===================================================================

Modified by Qianqian Fang <q.fang at neu.edu>

Date: 2008/08

== Summary ==
The change is trivial, simply replace the input/outputs from
WRL to OFF.

However, if one want to compile JMeshLib on 64 bit linux,
you will encounter the following error:

 error: cast from 'const void*' to 'int' loses precision

to get around this, you have to replace (int) to (long) 
for most of the lines you get the error messages.

== Compilation ==
First, download the JMeshLib source code from 
http://jmeshlib.sourceforge.net/

Unzip the file, and compile it based on the README file.

Replace the test/test.cpp and test/Makefile files by
the ones from this package, and type "make".

Rename the generated meshfix binary to meshfix.mex???
where mex??? is the output for mexext from matlab.
