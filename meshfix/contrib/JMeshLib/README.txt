JMeshLib provides a framework to work with manifold triangle meshes.
It implements an edge-based data structure with all its fundamental
functionalities (i.e., file I/O, mesh construction/destruction, traversal).
It is written in C++ and includes support for reading and writing the
following file formats:
OFF (http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/documentation/off_format.html)
PLY (http://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/Powerplant/Ply.doc)
STL (http://www.sdsc.edu/tmf/Stl-specs/stl.html)
VER-TRI (proprietary format used at IMATI-GE / CNR)
and partially:
IV 2.1, VRML 1.0, VRML 2.0, OBJ.

In contrast to other generic libraries dealing with surface meshes,
JMeshLib includes tools to automatically fix the most common problems
present in surface meshes coming from laser scanning (conversion to
oriented manifold, topological noise detection, hole filling, removal
of degenerate faces, ...) through a clear and easy-to-learn C++ API.

This package provides pre-compiled static libraries Windows only (lib/jmesh.lib).
For Linux you must compile the source tree yourself.

See the comments within the source files for details or use doxygen to
produce documentation in a more readable format.
The file "tin.h" is a good starting point.

-------------------
System Rrequirements
--------------------

JMeshLib v1.0 has been extensively tested on 32 bit PCs running either:
 - ELF Linux with standard development tools (gcc/g++)
 - Windows OS with MSVC 8.0 (Visual C++ 2005)

In version 1.1 it should compile and work properly on 64-bit Linux
machines too. Uncomment the proper line in the 'makeconf' to create
64-bit-enabled binaries.

-------------------
Building the tree
-------------------

On WINDOWS: double-click on minJMeshLib.vcproj and press F7.
On Linux: type 'make' on the command line.

On Linux systems you need the command 'makedepend'. If you
don't have it installed on your system, you may need to
download and install the 'imake' package.

-------------------
Using the library
-------------------

On WINDOWS:
Add the path to jmesh's include dir to your project's include path
AND
add the path to jmesh.lib to your linker's command line

On Linux:
Add the path to jmesh's include dir to your project's include path
AND
add the path to jmesh.a to your linker's command line
