From 1.0 to 1.1

- SymMatrix3x3
  - added == and != operators
  - added method 'determinant'
  - added = operator
  - added trace method
  - added /= operator
  - added lrMultiply for different vectors

- Matrix3x3
  - added constructor from vector product
  - added lrMultiply for different vectors
  - added = operator
  - added /= operator
  - added transpose

- SymMatrix4x4
  - added == and != operators

- List
  - Added method 'popTail()'
  - Corrected List::joinTailList(l) (buggy when l was empty)
  - removeNode now returns the index of the removed element
  - Added method 'getNode'

- Triangulation
  - Clone constructor does no longer destroy info fields
  - Clone constructor allows to clone info fiels too (setting non-default second par)
  - CreateEdge modified. e0 pointer for vertices now points to new edge after creation.
  - CheckConnectivity does no longer exit in case of error. Now it returns the error string.

- I/O
  - Updates for 64bit systems (to be checked carefully !)
  - Small bug-fix in ply loader

- selectConnectedComponent and selectBoundaryTriangles return the # of selected tris
- growSelection returns the # of newly selected tris

- Point.cpp
 - getAngle() does no longer exit with error. Warning + return -1 now.

- splitTriangle
 - Bug-fix: when splitEdge was invoked for robustness the method crashed

- JMesh
 - added 'quiet' field to prevent message reporting
