== # Introduction ==

"iso2mesh" is a Matlab/Octave-based mesh generation toolbox. 
It contains a number of optimized mesh processing scripts 
and interfaces with a number of free meshing tools, such as 
surface mesh simplifier and extraction utilities (based on 
CGAL), tetgen, and mesh validation&repairing utility (based 
on JMeshLib). Iso2mesh toolbox provides a simple yet powerful 
way to create quality tetrahedral volumetric mesh directly 
from 3D binary, segmented or gray-scale images such as those 
from MRI or CT scans.

To be able to create volumetric finite-element mesh from 
3D volumetric images is of great interest for researchers 
in the field of image-based modeling and analysis. 
Unfortunately, very limited software packages for this 
purpose can be found in publications and market; they
are either limited in functionalities or very expensive 
(such as Amira from Mercury Computer Systems). This toolbox 
was developed as a free alternative to the expensive 
commertial tools and provides researchers a complete 
workflow from 3D binary image preprocessing (hole-filling 
and island-removing), to surface mesh modeling (extraction, 
remeshing, validation, repairing, and smoothing) and 
volumetric mesh creation. Users can either choose the 
streamlined wrapper scripts to create 3D mesh with a 
fully automated process, or to call invidual subroutines 
to perform specific meshing tasks, such as closed surface 
extraction or boundary extraction.
