%   demo script for mesh generation from binarized volumetric image
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% preparation
% user must add the path of iso2mesh to matlab path list
% addpath('../');

% user need to add the full path to .../iso2mesh/bin directory
% to windows/Linux/Unix PATH environment variable

%% load the sample data
load sampleVol2Mesh.mat

% volimage is a volumetric image such as an X-ray or MRI image
% A,b are registration matrix and vector, respectively
%% perform mesh generation

[node,elem,bound]=vol2mesh(volimage>0.05,1:size(volimage,1),1:size(volimage,2),...
                           1:size(volimage,3),3,2,1);

%% alternatively, one can use the following cmd as a less robust approach
% [node,elem,bound]=vol2mesh(volimage>0.05,1:size(volimage,1),1:size(volimage,2),...
%                           1:size(volimage,3),0.2,2,1,'simplify');

%% visualize the resulting mesh

if(isoctavemesh)
        trimesh(bound(:,1:3),node(:,1),node(:,2),node(:,3));
else
        trisurf(bound(:,1:3),node(:,1),node(:,2),node(:,3));
end
axis equal;
