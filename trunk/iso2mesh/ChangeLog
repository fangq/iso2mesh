           and surf2mesh, respectively; added demo script for shortcuts
        8. mcpath searches <iso2mesh>/bin first, no PATH setting is required
           (thanks to Aslak Grinsted)
        9. many other minor fixes and cleaning

2009/02/11 (0.7.9-1, codename: Hotpot-beta)
        1. compiled all the binaries on Mac OS (PowerPC) and
           tested on an Intel Mac
        2. recompiled all linux and windows binaries with optimized speed
           and reduced system dependencies
        3. speeded up bounary field calculation with dedicated imedge3d
        4. added TODO

2009/02/07 (0.7.9, codename: Hotpot-alpha)
        1. incorporated CGAL Surface mesher as the default vol2surf
           mesh extraction scheme (thank to Pierre Alliez's suggestion
           and Laurent Rineau and Mariette Yvinec for developing this utility)
        2. added sub-region labeling for multi-valued images
        3. added cgalsurf binaries for Windows
        4. tested the toolbox with Octave for Windows on a vista machine,
           applied a few fixes to make it compatible
        5. recompiled tetgen.exe to get the max-element-volume constraint
           finally work

2008/12/27 (0.7.8, codename: Hotpot-alpha)
        1. try to handle the self-intersecting element problems, 
           added getintersecttri.m to extract intesecting element IDs
        2. implemented Laplacian-HC and Low-pass filter mesh smoothing
           algorithms; unfortunately, they are not effective to remove the 
           self-intersecting elements
        3. sent email to CGAL list to ask advices to handle self-intersecting
           element.

2008/12/05 (0.6.0, codename: Quesadilla)
        1. iso2mesh is now compatible with GNU Octave.
        2. replaced matlab's isosurface by a home-made binsurface to produce
           well-behaved triangular or cubic surfaces from binary images
        3. added qmeshcut, a fast tetrahedral mesh cross-section plot
        4. updated tetgen binary for 64bit Linux (mexa64), which caused some crashes
        5. provided instructions when user encounters a "permission denied" error

2008/11/08 (0.5.1, codename: Footlong)
        1. added meshing tool binaries for Windows (95-vista)
        2. added meshing tool binaries for Mac OS
        3. tagged all bin/ files and binaries files in sample/
           with -kb option in the cvs

2008/10/30 (0.5, alpha release, codename: Footlong)
        1. created a sourceforge project, pointing to 
           the project main page at orbit.
        2. wrote documents and polish file structures
        3. included more sample codes and data
        4. defined a global variable "ISO2MESH_TEMP" to control the 
           temporary file directory; "ISO2MESH_BIN" for bin folder
           location and "ISO2MESH_SESSION" for temporary file prefix
           and enable parallel meshing sessions and restricted user 
           environments
        5. renamed all temporary files as pre_smesh/post_smesh/
           pre_remesh/post_remeshpre_vmesh/post_vmesh to identify
           the processing stage
        6. split vol2mesh into vol2surf and surf2mesh
        7. uploading wiki pages with documentation drafts and 
           examples outputs

2008/10/10 (0.4)
        1. added subroutines for mesh validation and repairing
        2. included JMeshLib for non-manifold node removal

2008/01/10 (0.3)
        1. added vol2mesh and the related scripts
        2. iso2mesh is able to mesh breast geometry from 3D 
           tomosynthesis scan and a mouse head model from CT images.

2008/04/08 (0.2)
        1. qslim produces self-intersecting meshes after 
           simplification, which is not good. It is now replaced
           by CGAL mesh simplification module
        2. modified CGAL mesh simplification code to preserve all
           edges nodes (keep them co-planar)

2007/12/27 (0.1.1)
        1. used mexext to distinguish binaries for different platforms

2007/11/25 (0.1)
        1. initial upload to cvs, as a module of redbird2
        2. used qslim to perform mesh simplification and tetgen 
         for mesh generation
        3. supported both win32 and Linux
        4. added sample data and scripts
