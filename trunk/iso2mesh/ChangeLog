     iso2mesh - a simple yet powerful mesh generator

----------------------------------------------------------

iso2mesh ChangeLog:

2008/10/25 (0.5, alpha release)
        1. created a sourceforge project, pointing to 
           the project main page at orbit.
        2. wrote documents and polish file structures
        3. included more sample codes and data
        4. drafted the documentations

2008/10/10 (0.4)
        1. added subroutines for mesh validation and repairing
        2. included JMeshLib for non-manifold node removal

2008/01/10 (0.3)
        1. added vol2mesh and the related scripts
        2. iso2mesh is able to mesh breast geometry from 3D 
           tomosynthesis scan and a mouse head model from CT images.

2008/04/08 (0.2)
        1. qslim produces self-intersecting meshes after 
           simplification, which is not good. It is now replaced
           by CGAL mesh simplification module
        2. modified CGAL mesh simplification code to preserve all
           edges nodes (keep them co-planar)

2007/12/27 (0.1.1)
        1. used mexext to distinguish binaries for different platform

2007/11/25 (0.1)
        1. initial upload to cvs, as a module of redbird2
        2. used qslim to perform mesh simplification and tetgen 
         for mesh generation
        3. supported both win32 and Linux
        4. added sample data and scripts
