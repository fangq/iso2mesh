I. Introduction

Iso2mesh is a matlab-based meshing toolbox. It is packed
with a number of important meshing tools, such as 
surface simplifier (based on CGAL), tetgen and mesh
validation&repair utility (based on JMeshLib), and 
provide a simple yet powerful way to make quality 
tetrahedral volumetric mesh from isosurfaces, or a 
3D binary images (such as threholded MRI/CT images).

To be able to create volumetric FEM mesh from 3D binary
images is of great interests for researchers in the field
of image-based modeling and analysis. Unfortunately, 
very limited utilities for this purpose can be found
and they are usually very expensive (such as amira 
from Mercury Inc.). 

This toolbox was developed as a free alternative to
the expensive commertial tools and provides researchers 
a complete workflow from 3D binary image preprocessing 
(hole-filling and island-removing), to surface mesh 
modeling (extraction, remeshing, validation, repairing, 
and smoothing), to volumetric mesh creation. Users can 
either choose the streamlined driver script to create
3D mesh with a fully automated process, or call invidual
subroutines to perform specific meshing task, such as 
closed component extraction or boundary extraction.
