                         iso2mesh TODO list
====================================================================

== high priority ==

* detect multi-value interfaces (i.e. voxels where more than 2 values meet) \
and perturb the levelset surface mesh to avoid intersection [proposed on 02/11/09]

* if one levelset contains multiple disjointed surfaces, separate them, \
and do sub-region labeling for each component [proposed on 02/11/09]

== low priority ==

* 2D image-based mesh generation support ? [proposed on 02/11/09]

* adaptive refining [proposed on 02/11/09]

* moving mesh

* edge sharpening



== completed ==

* on Windows, the deletemeshfile will gave warning message, seemed the \
files were opened but not closed and can not be deleted \

* processing gray-scale images directly [proposed on 02/11/09] \
- done, by FangQ 2009/05/04

* setting RNG seeds when calling CGAL tools to ensure repeatibility \
of the meshing [proposed 07/17/2010] \
- done, by FangQ 2010/11/08
