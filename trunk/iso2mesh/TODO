                         iso2mesh TODO list
====================================================================

== high priority ==

1. detect multi-value interfaces (i.e. voxels where more than 2 values meet)
and perturb the levelset surface mesh to avoid intersection [proposed on 02/11/09]

2. if one levelset contains multiple disjointed surfaces, separate them, 
and do sub-region labeling for each component [proposed on 02/11/09]


== low priority ==

1. processing gray-scale images directly [proposed on 02/11/09]

2. 2D image-based mesh generation support ? [proposed on 02/11/09]

3. adaptive refining [proposed on 02/11/09]


== Known issues ==

1. on Windows, the deletemeshfile will gave warning message, seemed the
files were opened but not closed and can not be deleted
