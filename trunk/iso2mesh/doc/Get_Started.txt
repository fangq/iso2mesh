Getting Started with iso2mesh

   Despite that iso2mesh provides a rich collection of mesh-related
   functions, such as edge extraction, disjointed surface component
   extraction etc, the core functionalities, i.e. creating volumetric
   meshes from surfaces or binary image stacks, are very straightforward
   to use. A minimum step to perform such tasks only requires about 3 to 5
   lines of matlab code. You can find some examples from the sample/
   directory. In [14]this page, we summarize the overall work-flow of this
   toolbox.

   To outline a simple meshing session, let's assume you have a 3D image
   array, named "mydata", saved in a file called mydata.mat. Variable
   mydata can be any 3D image, a MRI/CT scan or a simple binary mask
   produced by your own command. Here are the commands you need to produce
   a volumetric FEM mesh from this volume:

 load mydata.mat
 [node,elem,face]=v2m(mydata,0.5,5,100);
 % or you can use the verbose form:
 % [node,elem,face]=vol2mesh(mydata>0,1:size(mydata,1),1:size(mydata,2),...
                           1:size(mydata,3), 5, 100, 1,'cgalsurf');
 plotmesh(node,face)
 % be careful, the last column of face is a label, should not be used for plotti
ng, same for elem

   Needless to explain, the first line loads the data to your current
   session. The second line calls an iso2mesh function, 'v2m', shortcut
   for vol2mesh, to construct a volumetric mesh from this data array. The
   first argument of v2m, "mydata", is the volumetric image you are about
   to mesh; the 2nd argument is the threshold value at which you define
   the boundary surface of the mesh; the 3rd argument, 5, defines the
   maximum size of the surface triangles; the last argument, 100, defines
   the maximum volume of the resulting tetrahedral elements. You can
   define a vector for the second argument, telling iso2mesh to produce
   multiple level-sets as the exterior or internal interfaces of the
   target domain. Both the 3rd and 4th arguments controls the density of
   the resulting mesh: the smaller the values, the more triangles on the
   surface and more tetrahedra in the volumetric mesh.

   There are 3 outputs from v2m command:
     * node: the node coordinates for the generated volumetric mesh, with
       dimension of NN x 3, with each column being x, y and z,
       respectively.
     * elem: the tetrahedral element info, with a dimension of NE x 4;
       each row represents an element, and each column are the node
       indices of each corner of the tetrahedron
     * face: triangular surface element info, with a dimension of NS x
       4,;the first 3 columns are the node indices of each corner of the
       triangle, and the last column is a flag to identify its mapping to
       the original surface id.
