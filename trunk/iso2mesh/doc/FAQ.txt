1. I am getting a "Two subfaces ... are found intersecting each other" error,
what should I do?

   This is the most frequently encountered problem using this toolbox.
   There are three possible scenarios to cause this error:

1. the volume you are trying to mesh contains regions whose boundaries
intersect each other

   This is mostly likely happening when you see the above error message.
   Please investigate your image by plotting the slices, and pay attention
   to any voxels whose neighbors have more than 2 different values. If you
   do see these type of voxels, unfortunately, iso2mesh can not handle
   this situation at this point. Here are two possible solutions:
    1. if these type of voxels are not many, you can manually edit your
       image and disconnect the regions that share the same boundary and
       make sure all the sub-regions are either completely disjointed, or
       completely enclosed by another.
    2. merge the regions that have conflict boundaries, and mesh the
       resulting merged image; after you get the tetrahedra, compute the
       centroid of each element in the merged domain (by their labels),
       and map them back to your original segmented image; determine the
       original region id using the voxel contain your centroid.

   Any suggestions to enable iso2mesh to handle this kind of situation is
   also appreciated.

2. you are using 'simplify' method to mesh a complex domain

   There are two methods for volume to surface conversion, 'simplify' and
   'cgalsurf'. The second method always returns a well-posed surface where
   no self-intersecting elements present. However, the 'simplify' approach
   does not. The default method for vol2mesh/vol2surf (v2m/v2s) is
   'cgalsurf'. If you have to use 'simplify', you may have to try
   different surface density for the surface extraction, and you may by
   lucky to find a working configuration, but very difficult. Please use
   'cgalsurf' whenever possible.

3. your surface mesh is too coarse and cause intersection for closed
interfaces

   The mesh extraction does not exactly preserve the node position on the
   interface. If you are meshing a very thin layer with two
   small-separation surfaces, the resulting surface may intersect each
   other if your surface element is too large. Please use a small
   opt.radbound number to run the mesh generation again.

2. After mesh generation, the plotted surface looked messed up, what was
wrong?

   It is very likely you incorrectly used the output variables. The output
   of vol2mesh or surf2mesh include elem: the tetrahedral element indices,
   and face: the surface triangle indices. But be careful, both of these
   two arrays have an additional column. The last column is a label field,
   indicating the origin (sub-region) of the elements. You should never
   use the last columns of these two arrays for plotting. To make a
   correct surface plot, you should use something like
 trisurf(face(:,1:3),node(:,1),node(:,2),node(:,3));

   and don't use the full face array as the first parameter.

3. Matlab complains about imread, imclose or imfill missing

   Under the sample/ directory, demo_vol2mesh_ex2.m requires imread, which
   is a build-in function in matlab, but not in octave. You have to
   install octave-image via apt-get or yum first. In example
   demo_vol2mesh_ex3.m, functions imclose and imfill are needed. These two
   functions can only be found in matlab's image processing toolbox. If
   you don't have this toolbox installed (of course, it is not free), you
   can simply pass this example. For octave, unfortunately, these
   functions do not exist yet, and hopefully someone can fill them in
   soon.

4. iso2mesh failed when writing files to disk

   If you are working on a multi-user workstation, and multiple users were
   using iso2mesh, some temporary files may have a conflict in read/write
   permission under /tmp directory. If user A runs iso2mesh first, and
   user B will get this error, because iso2mesh fails to create the
   temporary files as it does not have the permissions to overwrite those
   files created by A. To solve this issue, please define your own
   temporary folder, or set your session id, you can find more info at
   [6]Advanced page.
