How to obtain iso2mesh

          1. [2]Download the latest release (v0.5.1, alpha, codenamed Footlong)

          2. [3]Download from CVS (not fully tested)

                2.1. [4]Anonymous CVS Access

                2.2. [5]Developer CVS Access via SSH

          3. [6]Important Note on Licenses

1. Download the latest release (v0.5.1, alpha, codenamed Footlong)

   Please download the latest v0.5.1 release at our [7]registration/download
   page. We are greatly appreciated if you can tell us a little bit about you
   and your related research by [8][registering your copy of iso2mesh].

2. Download from CVS (not fully tested)

   If  you want to get the latest development branch of iso2mesh, you can
   download it from our cvs. First, make sure you have installed cvs client on
   your  system. If you are using Debian-based GNU/Linux systems (such as
   Ubuntu, Knoppix etc), you can install cvs by

 sudo apt-get install cvs

   if you are using Redhat-based GNU/Linux systems (such as Fedora, CentOS
   etc), you can do this by
 sudo yum install cvs

   If  your  operation  system  is  Windows,  we recommend you to install
   [9][TortoiseCVS].

2.1. Anonymous CVS Access

   This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous (pserver)
   CVS with the following instruction set. The module you wish to check out
   must  be specified as the modulename. When prompted for a password for
   anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/iso2mesh login
 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/iso2mesh checkout iso2mesh

2.2. Developer CVS Access via SSH

   Only project developers can access the CVS tree via this method. SSH must be
   installed on your client machine. Substitute modulename and developername
   with the proper values. Enter your site password when prompted.

 export CVS_RSH=ssh
 cvs -d :ext:developername@orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/iso2mesh checkout iso2mesh

3. Important Note on Licenses

   The iso2mesh toolbox is licensed under [10][GNU Public License (GPL)].
   However, it included a number of external tools (under bin/ directory) to
   perform certain functionalities by means of [11][pipelines]. These external
   tools are subjected to their upstream licenses and are not necessarily GPL
   (or GPL compatible). The complete list of these external commands and their
   author info and licenses can be found from the [12][README page].

   Particularly, the 3D meshing tool, tetgen, is licensed under a non-free
   license: it can be freely used, modified, redistributed only for research
   and  academic  purposes,  any  commercial utility of tetgen requires a
   permission from its [13][original author]. iso2mesh calls tetgen in the
   background to produce 3D mesh, that means if anyone needs to uses the 3D
   mesh produced by iso2mesh in a commercial product, you MUST contact the
   author of tetgen to get permission. Processing binary images and produce
   surfaces are not subject to this limitation.

   In additional to the licenses, if you use this tool in your research, we are
   greatly appreciated if you can add iso2mesh to your references:

 gray-scale images," IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2009 (submitted)

   alternatively, you can cite [15][our papers that described this toolbox].
