How to obtain iso2mesh

          1. [2]Download the latest release

          2. [3]Download Development Snapshot from CVS (not fully tested)

                2.1. [4]Anonymous CVS Access

                2.2. [5]Developer CVS Access via SSH

          3. [6]Important Note on Licenses

1. Download the latest release

iso2mesh 0.7.9-1, beta codenamed Hotpot

   Please download the latest v0.7.9-1 release at our [7]registration/download page. We are
   greatly appreciated if you can tell us a little bit about you and your related research by
   [8][registering your copy of iso2mesh].

2. Download Development Snapshot from CVS (not fully tested)

   If you want to get the latest development branch of iso2mesh, you can download it from our
   cvs. First, make sure you have installed cvs client on your system. If you are using
   Debian-based GNU/Linux systems (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix etc), you can install cvs by
 sudo apt-get install cvs

   if you are using Redhat-based GNU/Linux systems (such as Fedora, CentOS etc), you can do
   this by
 sudo yum install cvs

   If your operation system is Windows, we recommend you to install [9][TortoiseCVS].

2.1. Anonymous CVS Access

   This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with the
   following instruction set. The module you wish to check out must be specified as the
   modulename. When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/iso2mesh login
 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/iso2mesh checkout iso2mesh

2.2. Developer CVS Access via SSH

   Only project developers can access the CVS tree via this method. SSH must be installed on
   your client machine. Substitute modulename and developername with the proper values. Enter
   your site password when prompted.

 export CVS_RSH=ssh
 cvs -d :ext:developername@orbit.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/iso2mesh checkout iso2mesh

3. Important Note on Licenses

   The iso2mesh toolbox is licensed under [10][GNU Public License (GPL)]. However, it included
   a number of external tools (under bin/ directory) to perform certain functionalities by
   means of [11][pipelines]. These external tools are subjected to their upstream licenses and
   are not necessarily GPL (or GPL compatible). The complete list of these external commands
   and their author info and licenses can be found from the [12][README page].

   Particularly, the 3D meshing tool, tetgen, is licensed under a non-free license: it can be
   freely used, modified, redistributed only for research and academic purposes, any
   commercial utility of tetgen requires a permission from its [13][original author]. iso2mesh
   calls tetgen in the background to produce 3D mesh, that means if anyone needs to uses the
   3D mesh produced by iso2mesh in a commercial product, you MUST contact the author of tetgen
   to get permission. Processing binary images and produce surfaces are not subject to this
   limitation.

   In additional to the licenses, if you use this tool in your research, we are greatly
   appreciated if you can add iso2mesh to your references:
