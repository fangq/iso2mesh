Installation Instructions for iso2mesh toolbox

System Requirements

   iso2mesh is written by Matlab language (we will also provide the Scilab and
   Octaves versions in the near future), therefore, any system that is able to
   install Matlab (or Scilab or Octave) should be able to run this toolbox.
   However,  as we described in the [2]Doc/README, this toolbox relies on
   multiple external tools/libraries for full functionalities. So far, we have
   been compiled these external tools for multiple platforms, and we will
   provide more compiled binaries in the future.

   The recommended system configuration for running this toolbox includes
     * a computer running GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS (either 32bit/64bit)
     * standard installation of matlab (v5 or above)
     * 10M disk space for the toolbox and the examples

Installation

   The installation of iso2mesh to your system is very straightforward, you
   need to follow the simple instructions below:
     * extract the toolbox to a folder, say /home/myaccount/work/iso2mesh,
       let's call it the root directory of iso2mesh;
     * add the bin/ folder under the iso2mesh directory to your system's PATH
       environment variable, see [3]more details here;
     * start  your Maltab from a new shell (make sure the PATH setting is
       effective),  type  addpath('/home/myaccount/work/iso2mesh') to add
       iso2mesh to your matlab search path for the current session
     * if you want to add this path permanantly for matlab, you simply type
       pathtool, browse to the iso2mesh folder and add it to the list, then
       click "Save"
     * now, you can do a rehash in matlab, and type which vol2mesh, if you see
       an output, that means iso2mesh is now seen by matlab
     * you can navigate to a folder named "sample" inside iso2mesh's root
       directory, and run the demo scripts, you should be able to see the code
       complete with no error message. If it complains that some commands can
       not be found, make sure your PATH variable setting is effective.

For restricted users

   You do not have to have system administrator (or root) right in order to
   install/use iso2mesh toolbox. Most of the installation instructions can be
   done in a per user basis. The only problem a restricted user may encounter
   is to save the "pathtool" path list when they try to add the iso2mesh path
   permanently. If this happens, you may work in a multi-user or network-based
   system, you normally need to create file named startup.m under your home
   directory     (~/matlab/     for     Linux/Unix),    and    put    the
   addpath('/path/to/iso2mesh/'); into this file. It will be automatically
   executed when matlab starts.
